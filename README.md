# Todo-list


Todo List is a web application that allows users to organize their tasks and manage them efficiently.
The application enables users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, as well as manage tags that
symbolize the theme of each task.



## Features
Task Creation: Users can add new tasks, specifying their content, creation date, and, if necessary,
a deadline for completion.
View and Update Tasks: The application provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and editing existing tasks.
Users can mark tasks as done, edit their content, creation date, and deadline, as well as manage tags.
Tag Management: Each task can be associated with one or more tags that represent its theme or category.
 Users can create, view, update, and delete tags, as well as assign them to tasks.
